                        accuracy is prominently showcased in the middle of the
                        chart. The key takeaway regarding the Italian team's
                        performance is that their pass accuracy is above the
                        median among the listed teams. This indicates that while
                        Italy is not at the top in terms of pass accuracy, they
                        maintain a respectable performance, reflecting a solid
                        ability to maintain possession and execute successful
